### 🛠️	Create the Hangman Game

#### Description
Write a Python program that lets a player guess letters to reveal a randomly chosen word. The player has a limited number of incorrect guesses before the game ends.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Randomly select a word from a predefined list
- Accept letter guesses from the user
- Display current progress using underscores for hidden letters (e.g., _ a _ _ m a n)
- Track and display the number of incorrect guesses remaining
- End the game when the word is guessed or attempts are exhausted
- Show a win message if the player guesses the word, or a lose message if they run out of attempts

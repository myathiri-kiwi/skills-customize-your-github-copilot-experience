# 📘 Assignment: Building REST APIs with FastAPI

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to build and test RESTful APIs using the FastAPI framework in Python. You will create endpoints, handle requests and responses, and practice structuring a simple API project.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️	Create a Simple FastAPI Application

#### Description
Set up a FastAPI project and create a basic API with at least two endpoints. One endpoint should return a welcome message, and another should accept a parameter and return a personalized response.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Use FastAPI to create a web API
- Include at least two endpoints (e.g., GET /welcome, GET /greet/{name})
- Return JSON responses
- Run locally and be accessible via browser or API client
- Include clear instructions for running the app

### 🛠️	Add a Data Model and CRUD Endpoints

#### Description
Extend your API to include a simple data model (e.g., a list of items or users) and implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for it.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Define a Pydantic model for your data
- Implement endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting items
- Store data in-memory (list or dictionary)
- Return appropriate status codes and error messages
- Demonstrate usage with example requests and responses
